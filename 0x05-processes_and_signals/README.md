Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is a PID
What is a process
How to find a processâ€™ PID
How to kill a process
What is a signal
What are the 2 signals that cannot be ignored

0. What is my PID
Write a Bash script that displays its own PID.

1. List your processes
Write a Bash script that displays a list of currently running processes.
Requirements:
Must show all processes, for all users, including those which might not have a TTY
Display in a user-oriented format
Show process hierarchy

2. Show your Bash PID
Using your previous exercise command, write a Bash script that displays lines containing the bash word, thus allowing you to easily get the PID of your Bash process.
Requirements:
You cannot use pgrep
The third line of your script must be # shellcheck disable=SC2009 (for more info about ignoring shellcheck error here)

3. Show your Bash PID made easy
Write a Bash script that displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word bash.
Requirements:
You cannot use ps

4. To infinity and beyond
Write a Bash script that displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely.
Requirements:
In between each iteration of the loop, add a sleep 2

5. Don't stop me now!
We stopped our 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process using ctrl+c in the previous task, there is actually another way to do this.
Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.
Requirements:
You must use kill

6. Stop me if you can
Write a Bash script that stops 4-to_infinity_and_beyond process.
Requirements:
You cannot use kill or killall

7. Highlander
Write a Bash script that displays:
To infinity and beyond indefinitely
With a sleep 2 in between each iteration
I am invincible!!! when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Make a copy of your 6-stop_me_if_you_can script, name it 67-stop_me_if_you_can, that kills the 7-highlander process instead of the 4-to_infinity_and_beyond one.

8. Beheaded process
Write a Bash script that kills the process 7-highlander.

9. Process and PID file
Write a Bash script that:
Creates the file /var/run/myscript.pid containing its PID
Displays To infinity and beyond indefinitely
Displays I hate the kill command when receiving a SIGTERM signal
Displays Y U no love me?! when receiving a SIGINT signal
Deletes the file /var/run/myscript.pid and terminates itself when receiving a SIGQUIT or SIGTERM signal

10. Manage my process
Programs that are detached from the terminal and running in the background are called daemons or processes, need to be managed. The general minimum set of instructions is: start, restart and stop. The most popular way of doing so on Unix system is to use the init scripts.
Write a manage_my_process Bash script that:
Indefinitely writes I am alive! to the file /tmp/my_process
In between every I am alive! message, the program should pause for 2 seconds
Write Bash (init) script 101-manage_my_process that manages manage_my_process. (both files need to be pushed to git)

11. Zombie
Write a C program that creates 5 zombie processes.
Requirements:
For every zombie process created, it displays Zombie process created, PID: ZOMBIE_PID
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
When your code is done creating the parent process and the zombies, use the function bellow
